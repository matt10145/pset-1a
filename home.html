        <p>David Julian Dobrik is a Slovak-born Youtube personality, currently with over 13 million subscribers on his channel. He first got his start on the social platform Vine in early 2013, where he amassed over 1 million followers. Dobrik frequently collaborated with other popular &#34;Viners,&#34; such as Liza Koshy, Zane Hijazi, Jason Nash, and Gabbie Hanna -- many eventually became members of the present &#34;Vlog Squad.&#34;</p>
