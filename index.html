    <p>David Julian Dobrik is a Slovak-born Youtube personality, currently with over 13 million subscribers on his channel. He first got his start on the social platform Vine in early 2013, where he amassed over 1 million followers. Dobrik frequently collaborated with other popular &#34;Viners,&#34; such as Liza Koshy, Zane Hijazi, Jason Nash, and Gabbie Hanna -- many eventually became members of the present &#34;Vlog Squad.&#34;</p>
    <p>Dobrik has been active on his self-titled Youtube channel for about four years, with 611 posted vlogs as of September 25th, 2019. In addition to his channel, Dobrik also runs a podcast named <em>Views,</em> where him and co-host Jason Nash talk about what they&#39;ve done in the past few days prior to each episode, with the occasional discussion of serious topics and interviews with friends. The featured guests now include Dillon Francis, Nicolas Lachey, and Jeff Wittek.</p>
