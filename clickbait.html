      <p>Clickbait, Dobrik&#39;s main tagline, now represents his series of merchandise. Dobrik sells a variety of Clickbait-themed clothing, including undergarments, t-shirts, hoodies, and sweatpants. In September 2019, &#34;The Beverly Collection,&#34; was revealed, a line of colorful, aesthetic hoodies with &#34;David Dobrik&#34; printed on each one. One could say that this was an unsual step away from the &#34;Clickbait&#34; catchphrase.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 100px">There have been a few merch fan favorites. One of them is the red garnet Clickbait hoodie, featured here. I personally own a sweater like this one -- it is my favorite due to it being Dobrik's first iconic hoodie. It also holds some emotional significance for me, as everytime I look at it, I am reminded of how my friend and I also used to match outfits with the sweater.</p>
